# Multiple-endpoints-mixed-continuous-and-binary
This script is for performing the Intersection-Union test (IUT) introduced in “A testing procedure in clinical trials with multiple endpoints that include mixed continuous and binary variables”.
The user must prepare data with one or two continuous endpoints and one or two binary endpoints.
In this IUT, the test is significant if there is non-inferiority for all of the multiple endpoints and superiority for at least one of them. The information required for input and an explanation of the results are given at the beginning of each script.
